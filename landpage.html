          <p class="scrollreveal">
            I am an Student and a volleyball player for Sesi, where I had the chance to attend Senai, the place that opened my eyes to programming languages and ignited a true passion in me. This interest wasn't just by chance, it was nurtured by a close relative, my uncle, who played a pivotal role in showing me the potential and excitement of coding. The blend of discipline, teamwork from sports, and the analytical, creative thinking involved in programming has greatly shaped who I am, allowing me to develop skills that go beyond the court and into the realm of technology.

            I gained my fluency in English through studying at Nimble, which is now known as Phenom. However, my ease with the language started early on, as I grew up playing video games. This exposure helped me develop an intuitive grasp of English from a young age, combining fun and learning in a way that set the foundation for my language skills. Over time, formal education polished this foundation, allowing me to become fluent and confident in using English in various settings.
